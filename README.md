## The Avian Project
*A monolithic C kernel for i386 processors.*

The Avian Project is a hobby OS started in January 2016 by Bryan Webb.
It began as a tutorial from the OSDev wiki, and when Bryan managed to
get his first "Hello World" to boot, he decided to continue with the project.

Originally titled "The Popcorn Kernel", the project was renamed to 
The Avian Project on 12 February, 2016.

The goal is to develop a functioning kernel with a full spectrum of
features. Currently, the goal is for x86 platforms, but support for ARM
and x86_64 should exist in the furure.

Avian will be written in pure C, with minimal assembly. The project uses 
the GNU gcc compiler, and is developed with Gedit and Gnome-terminal.
